Are you tired of searching multiple sites and having hundreds of tabs open to find one vacation rental? Our website searches for you, compiling all the available rooms or houses for you to easily browse. We have tools for you to help measure the safety of areas so you can feel secure in your choice, rank based on distance, number of rooms, and others. Best of all it's free to use and has no additional costs.

### Why we made it 

In order to eliminate this frustrating issue of having multiple tabs open and having to scour different sites searching the same keywords repeatedly, the goal of this project is to create a website that pulls listings from a variety of existing rental websites and compiles them in one place where users can easily view them. Our website will display listings from all the major rental home/room (generally for travel) websites such as Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, Trivago, Priceline, and Hotwire. This makes it easier for users to view and compare places to stay. However, our website will not process any bookings or transactions; it simply redirects them to the site of the original posting if the user decided that is the place they would like to book.

### Architecture 

Based on the needs of the system being developed we determined that the Model-View-Controller Software architecture pattern would be the best to use. The MVC architecture supports an adaptive rendering process, this means that we can handle many different screen resolutions easily. There are also plug-ins built for this architecture that provide templates for things like mobile view simplifying the entire process for us.
